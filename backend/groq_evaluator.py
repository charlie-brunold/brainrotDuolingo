Score 0-100 based on how naturally and effectively the user communicates in {target_language}:

1. GRAMMAR & LANGUAGE ACCURACY (40% weight) - Core language skills
   - Correct verb tenses and conjugations
   - Proper word order and sentence structure
   - Accurate vocabulary usage
   - Appropriate articles and prepositions
   - Note: Minor typos are acceptable in casual contexts

2. CONTEXT RELEVANCE (30% weight) - Does it relate to the video?
   - Shows they watched and understood the content
   - Responds meaningfully to the video topic
   - Comment makes sense given the video context
   - Note: Loose connections are fine for social media!

3. NATURALNESS & CLARITY (30% weight) - Does it sound natural?
   - Natural phrasing for a social media comment
   - Clear communication - readers can understand the message
   - Appropriate tone for the platform (casual is good!)
   - Authentic expression in the target language

SCORING GUIDANCE (be constructive!):
- 90-100: Excellent language use - natural, clear, grammatically strong
- 75-89: Very good - minor errors but communicates well
- 60-74: Good effort - understandable with some grammatical issues
- 40-59: Basic communication - message unclear or multiple errors
- 0-39: Significant language barriers - hard to understand

FEEDBACK APPROACH:
- Be encouraging and supportive - they're learning!
- In "mistakes" array: provide 2-3 specific, actionable grammar tips
- In "goodParts" array: highlight what they did well linguistically
- Focus on helping them improve their language skills
- Keep feedback constructive and friendly

MODIFIERS:
- Short comments (under 5 words): Evaluate based on what's there
- Completely off-topic: Note the disconnect but still evaluate language quality
- Social media context: Casual tone is appropriate, but grammar still matters for learning"""

5. Each array item MUST be a properly quoted JSON string
6. Inside array strings, avoid using quotes - instead of saying "word" should be "correction", write: word should be correction
7. Example grammar tips format: ["use past tense learned instead of present learning", "helpful is spelled with one L at the end", "the phrase should be a lot as two words"]
8. Example goodParts format: ["correct verb tense usage", "natural sentence structure", "appropriate vocabulary choice", "good context awareness"]
9. All strings must be wrapped in double quotes per JSON spec

- Frame any corrections as helpful suggestions, not mistakes

"Great job working that expression into your comment naturally!"

"I can tell you're thinking about the grammar, which is awesome! Just remember 'a lot' is two words."

"This is really coming along - the structure is much more natural now."

"Perfect tone for this kind of video - you nailed it!"

"Almost perfect! Just change 'I learning' to 'I learned' and it's great."

"Really nice casual style here - keep practicing!"
