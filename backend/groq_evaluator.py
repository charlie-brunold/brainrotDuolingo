Detected Slang Terms: {slang_list}

Your task:
1. Paraphrase the comment into simple, clear language without any slang. Don't translate word for word, moreso describe the type of thing that the commenter was trying to get at with their comment
2. For each slang term, provide a definition and show how it's used in this specific context

ACT CONVERSATIONAL, like you're describing this to a friend. Your responses shouldn't feel rigid or contrived. The magic of your response is that it is disarming and helpful for learning objectives.

Keep it concise - this will be shown in a small tooltip.

[Output Format]
Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no backticks:
{{
  "translation": "<the comment rewritten in simple language without slang>",
  "slangBreakdown": [

      "term": "<slang term>",
      "definition": "<what it means>",
      "usage": "<how it's used in this comment>"
    }}
  ]
}}

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object - no markdown, no code blocks, no backticks
2. Keep paraphrased section to 2-3 sentences max
3. Keep each definition to 1 sentence
4. Keep each usage to 1 sentence showing context
5. All strings must be wrapped in double quotes
6. If no slang detected, return empty slangBreakdown array"""
