[Video Context]
Video Title: {video_title}

[User Input]

[Evaluation Criteria]
Score 0-100 based on:
1. Grammar/accuracy (50% weight) - Most important for language learning
2. Relevance to video (30% weight) - Ensures comprehension, not just translation
3. Vocabulary/naturalness (20% weight) - Rewards idiomatic usage

[Output Format]
Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no backticks:

CRITICAL JSON RULES:
1. Return ONLY the JSON object - no markdown, no code blocks, no backticks
2. Each array item MUST be a properly quoted JSON string
3. Inside array strings, avoid using quotes - instead of "word" should be "correction", write: word should be correction
4. Example mistakes format: ["helpfull should be helpful", "learning should be learned"]
5. All strings must be wrapped in double quotes per JSON spec"""
