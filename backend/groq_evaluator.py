Score 0-100 based on how naturally the user communicates on social media:

1. CONTEXT RELEVANCE (30% weight) - Does it relate to the video?
   - Shows they watched and understood the content
   - Responds to something from the video
   - Note: Even loose connections are fine - this is social media!

2. TONE & NATURALNESS (30% weight) - Does it sound like a real comment?
   - Casual and conversational (formal is okay too, just different style)
   - Natural phrasing for the platform
   - Authentic expression
   - IMPORTANT: Slang is NOT required! Natural language without slang is perfectly fine

3. CLARITY (25% weight) - Can people understand it?
   - Main idea comes through
   - Makes sense to readers
   - Word choices work

4. LANGUAGE ACCURACY (15% weight) - Basic communication
   - Note: Perfect grammar NOT needed - this is social media!
   - Only flag things that really confuse the message
   - Typos and casual shortcuts are totally normal

SCORING GUIDANCE (be generous!):
- 85-100: Totally natural comment - fits right in (with or without slang)
- 70-84: Good comment with personality
- 50-69: Decent comment, maybe a bit awkward
- 30-49: Understandable but feels off
- 0-29: Hard to understand OR completely random/unrelated

CRITICAL - ABOUT SLANG:
- Do NOT penalize for lack of slang usage
- Do NOT suggest adding slang unless it's really natural for that context
- Many great comments use zero slang - that's totally fine!
- Only mention slang if they used it incorrectly
- Focus on natural communication, not slang usage

MODIFIERS:
- Short comments (under 5 words): No penalty! Short comments are super common
- Random comment with zero connection to video: Only then apply -20 penalty
- BE LENIENT: This is social media, not an essay. Casual = good!

IMPORTANT - KEEP FEEDBACK LIGHT:
- In the "mistakes" array, frame everything as friendly tips
- Maximum 2-3 tips - don't overwhelm them
- If off-topic, casually mention what the video is about: ["btw this video is about cooking tips"]
- Focus on helping them sound natural, not adding slang"""

4. Keep tips light and encouraging - this is social media, not an exam
5. DO NOT suggest adding slang unless it's truly natural for that context
6. Natural comments without slang deserve high scores too!
7. Each array item MUST be a properly quoted JSON string
8. Inside array strings, avoid using quotes - instead of "word" should be "correction", write: word should be correction
9. Example friendly tips format: ["could add more details about what you liked", "btw this video is about travel tips", "the phrasing could be more natural"]
10. Example goodParts format: ["clear and easy to understand", "sounds natural", "good connection to the video"]
11. All strings must be wrapped in double quotes per JSON spec

"Great job working that expression into your comment naturally!"

"I can tell you're thinking about the grammar, which is awesome! Just remember 'a lot' is two words."

"This is really coming along - the structure is much more natural now."

"Perfect tone for this kind of video - you nailed it!"

"Almost perfect! Just change 'I learning' to 'I learned' and it's great."

"Really nice casual style here - keep practicing!"
